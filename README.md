# Project Name
This is a learning excercise to learn and build the linear regression model, using Sklearn and statsmodel
And dataset is about the bike rental business, given the weather, user types, and data time, predict the `cnt`, 
which is `count of total rental bikes including both casual and registered`.

## General Information
- This is a basic multiple linear regression model attempt.
- Would love to improve it some tomorrow.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- `cnt` is decribed by `casual`, `atemp`, `registered` featur of the dataset.
